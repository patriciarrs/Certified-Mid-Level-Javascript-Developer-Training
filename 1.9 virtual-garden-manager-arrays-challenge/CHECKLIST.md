### Arrays

Arrays allow us to store lists of data.
For example, a list of products to display on an e-commerce site or a list of news articles to browse through.

For the exam, you should know the basics of working with arrays; things like: getting array length, adding new items to arrays, accessing an item at a specific index, removing items from arrays, and more.

For this exam, you’ll also need to know advanced array methods but we’ll cover that in the Advanced Array and Object Methods chapter.
