### Variables and Data Types

Variables are like containers where you can store and label different types of information.
That information can be a string of characters like those that makeup your name or a number that can be used in Math equations, like your age, or a variety of other types.

During the exam you’ll need to know the various ways of declaring variables with `let` and `const`.
You’ll also need to be familiar with primitive data types like strings, numbers, and booleans.
Later on we’ll also discuss more complex types, like arrays and objects.
